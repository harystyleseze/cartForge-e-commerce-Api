
### 1. **Key Areas for Order Statistics:**
#### For Users:
- **Total Orders:** The total number of orders the user has placed.
- **Order Status:** The count of orders in different statuses (e.g., Pending, Completed, Cancelled, etc.).
- **Total Spend:** The total amount the user has spent on orders.
- **Refunded Amount:** The total amount refunded to the user.
- **Discounts Used:** The total amount of discount the user has availed using coupons.
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** The average amount spent per order.

#### For Admins (Business Perspective):
- **Total Revenue:** The total revenue generated from all orders.
- **Order Status Breakdown:** A breakdown of orders by status (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Completed, Cancelled, etc.).
- **Payment Status Breakdown:** A breakdown of orders by payment status (e.g., Paid, Pending, Failed).
- **Refund Statistics:** Total refunded amount, number of refunded orders, and the remaining refundable amount.
- **Coupon Usage:** How often and how much value coupon codes have been used across all orders.
- **Total Items Sold:** The total number of items sold in all orders.
- **Sales by Currency:** The sales amount broken down by each supported currency.
- **Sales by Product:** The total sales per product.

### 2. **Order Statistics Route Design:**

Here is how you could structure your route to handle the **order statistics** for both users and admins:

#### For Users:
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/orders/statistics`
- **Query Parameters:** (Optional) You can allow the user to filter based on a date range or order status.
  
  Example: `/api/orders/statistics?startDate=2023-01-01&endDate=2023-12-31`

This would return the user's total orders, total spend, average order value, etc.

#### For Admins:
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/orders/statistics`
- This endpoint will give overall statistics for the business.

Example response for **Admin** (might include more aggregated data):

```json
{
  "totalRevenue": 100000,
  "orderStatusBreakdown": {
    "pending": 30,
    "shipped": 200,
    "completed": 500,
    "cancelled": 10
  },
  "paymentStatusBreakdown": {
    "paid": 650,
    "pending": 30,
    "failed": 10
  },
  "refundStatistics": {
    "totalRefunded": 5000,
    "numberOfRefundedOrders": 20
  },
  "totalItemsSold": 1500,
  "couponUsage": {
    "SUMMER2024": 100,
    "WINTER2024": 50
  },
  "salesByCurrency": {
    "USD": 70000,
    "EUR": 30000
  }
}
```
### 4. **Business Areas to Consider for Both User and Admin:**
#### User:
- **Personal Spending:** The total amount spent by the user on all orders.
- **Order History:** The user may want to know the number of successful or failed orders.
- **Refunds:** Users are interested in the total amount refunded to them and the remaining refundable amount.
  
#### Admin:
- **Total Revenue and Profit:** For overall business health.
- **Order Distribution:** Insights into order status (Pending, Completed, Cancelled) and payment status (Paid, Pending, Failed).
- **Refund Trends:** Business should track refund amounts and trends for possible fraud prevention or policy review.
- **Coupon Usage:** Track how often coupons are used to gauge marketing campaigns.
- **Item Popularity:** Track which products are selling the most.
